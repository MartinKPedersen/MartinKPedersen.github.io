      In the video shown on 'The Project' tab, it is mentioned in the end that we had found another dataset more capable to shed some light on the topic in focus. That is the data, which in the end was chosen for this assignment. Before going more into depth, here is a link to <a href="http://data.kk.dk/dataset/sociookonomisk-status-ledighed-efter-ar-forsikringskategori-ledighedsgrad-alder-og-uddannelse" target="_blank">the data</a>. <br><br>

      The reasoning behind choosing this data over the other, is that the other data did not include any good indicator other peoples' civil state, that could give a hint to their economical state. 
      Their economical state


        The data used is from the dataset “Socioeconomic status and employment by years, insurance category, level of employment, age and education” and is available here*link*.

The data is split into seven attributes: Year, Age, District of Copenhagen, IE-Type, Social group, Social status and People. 

Year, Age and District of Copenhagen are rather self explanatory. IE-Type gives us the ancestry of each individual. This is divided into three subgroups, danish, immigrant or immigrant descendant. 

Social group refers to the three overarching groups of employment: Employed, Unemployed or Outside the workforce.

Social status is particularly interesting, since this consists of a rather varying range of numbers. Each number is a code used to describe the individual's relation to the danish workforce. For the sake of keeping our analysis simple and to the point we are only looking at three of the largest categories, which are the three salary groups: 1. Employees at the highest level, 2. Employees at medium level, 3. Employees at ground level. 

Finally we have People which describes how many people are defined by the previously mentioned categories. This effectively means that each line within the dataset refers to a group rather than a single individual.
