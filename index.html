<b>The Project</b>
<br></br>
This website is created for the course 02806 - Social data analysis and visualization. The website serves as our final product, which is a culmination of everything we have worked with during the course. 
<br></br>
<b>Disclaimer</b>
Since the making of the above video this project has changed its direction.
<br></br>
<ul>
  <li type="square">We no longer seek to understand the popularity of districts within Copenhagen</li>
  <li>We no longer seek to understand the popularity of districts within Copenhagenk</li>
</ul>
Popularity is such an indeterminable term and our data simply does not justify us presuming that we can effectively evaluate popularity based on salaries of citizens. 
<br></br>
<b>The (new) project: ECOpenhagen</b><br></br>
The new direction of our project is about the distribution of citizens in Copenhagen districts based on individual salaries. We aim to investigate how the distribution of high and low income citizens has developed from the year 1997 to 2013.
<br></br>
Our primary focus is to evaluate whether these “rich” and “poor” city districts has had an influx of young people and/or immigrants and whether this has had an effect on their overall social economical distribution 
<br></br>
In order for you to investigate our findings a variety of visualizations along with our overall analysis is available in the Analysis section. If you desire to learn more about the data used for this analysis check out the Data section.
